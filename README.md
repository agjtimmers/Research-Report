# Research-Report
This repository contains all files needed to reproduce my research report on the use of propensity score matching to reduce bias in cross-country comparisons in PISA, written in latex. When you download the contents of this repository in a zip file, you only need to run ResearchReport.tex to get ResearchReport.pdf. Map - Figure 2.R and PISA18_subset.rds are included for reference on how mode_map.png was created.
